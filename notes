TO DO

[x] change is active class when different tab clicked On
[x] set main view to drinks for category, including a h2, when a category is clicked

[x] style
[x] add ingredient tab
[x] add glass tab
[x] h2s
[x] better style on categorisation pages
[x] subtitle saying what the site is

[] reactrouter :: unable to work out how to use this with my structure
[x] handle no results :: the common occurance for this was due to children of the onclick div not inheriting the datasets (see question below)
[] handle search errors / nothing returned from JSON (should cover clicked or searched scenarios if I get it right)
[x] mobile
[] close mobile nav when menu item clicked
[] change burger to an x when mobile menu open
[] change styling on category pages so chalkboards are variying sizes based on content rather than static (need the styling in a div within my flexed div I think )




QUESTIONS I HAVE

> see Categories.js as example
when setting onclick, can you specify the datasets once and then have all the children include them for the onclick call?
beacuse of this I couldn't get it to consistently work correctly if you happen to click the fontawesome icon

> React router 
with the way I've set up the call API and show page on demand, how would you attach router to it


COMMENTS

> API calls 
this API does not return a full list of all drinks, it requires you to call a subsset, hence the multiple calls on demand rather than front loading results


> Libraries
- styled-components for adding css styles in the js : added this when I was testing creating dynamic background-images based on data being called from the API, however I ultimately decided not to use background images
- react router dom for better URLs
- react lazy hero for nice hero image loading and effects (which also requires styled components!)
